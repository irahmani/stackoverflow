# stackoverflow
A clone of stackoverflow to showcase my talent for php developer assignment.

Some of the key points of the project are;
- The project is designed using SOLID principles
- The project will use Laravel for backend and api
- The project will use Vue.js in front-end
- The project will be structured and managed code

The project will be a typical clone of the StackOverflow Application. The users can create account, login and add questions as well as answer or vote the existing answers and mark the answer as correct.
